Request at: https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/blob/e20b168e71703923a99816f1c2e6867aa813ee6a/request/descier_grant_for_jole.md

## Committee decision

The Committee will follow the next steps outlined in the Lead's reasons. The Committee has decided against offering the grant.

## bestape reasons (Lead)

From https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants#grant-request-process , the Grant's Committee's current goals are:

* measuring and storytelling LexDAO's impact, with a flywheel included (invest in the Grants Committee)
* members hosting events or representing LexDAO at events, with a flywheel included (invest in generating the Events Committee)
* expanding our media and media distribution, with a flywheel included (invest in the Comms Committee)

That means this grant should land in one of these three `TYPE_investment` tags:

1. `report_investment` if it helps tell LexDAO's impact story
2. `event_investment` if it involves LexDAO hosting events or LexDAO members attending events
3. `promote_investment` if it helps distribute LexDAO opportunities such as our events, publications and offshoot products or services

After a long discussion, we decided that we need to limit grants to invest only in Grants Committee, Events Committee or Comms Committee. As Descier is an outside organization that is not being used by one of these committees, we cannot give it a grant at this time.

We are still very optimistic about Descier and hope that the entire DAO supports The Journal of Legal Engineering "JoLE" when the time comes to support this collaboration.
