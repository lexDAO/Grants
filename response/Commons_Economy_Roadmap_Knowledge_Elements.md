Request at: https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/blob/main/request/Commons_Economy_Roadmap_Knowledge_Elements.md , https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/commit/986f80525f49b370bf8b5d32d0023751cbcb1920

## Committee decision

The Committee will follow the next steps outlined in the Lead's reasons.

## bestape reasons (Lead)

From https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants#grant-request-process , the Grant's Committee's current goals are:

* measuring and storytelling LexDAO's impact, with a flywheel included (invest in the Grants Committee)
* members hosting events or representing LexDAO at events, with a flywheel included (invest in generating the Events Committee)
* expanding our media and media distribution, with a flywheel included (invest in the Comms Committee)

That means this grant should land in one of these three `TYPE_investment` tags:

1. `report_investment` if it helps tell LexDAO's impact story
2. `event_investment` if it involves LexDAO hosting events or LexDAO members attending events
3. `promote_investment` if it helps distribute LexDAO opportunities such as our events, publications and offshoot products or services

Given our conversations with CER, their reputation in the grants community and our pressing need to develop annual report materials, paying CER for another knowledge element "KE" on top of the free KE they already made about us fits our `report_investment` goals.

I approve the grant for one KE at $500.

### next steps

- [ ] We tell CER the news they've been approved for one KE at $500
- [ ] We ask CER where to send funds
- [ ] We send CER funds after they complete the KE

## Tertius reasons

 Approve 1 KE for pilot engagement with CER and an eye toward future utilization
     Approved based on
         - limited cost for initial effort and test case
         - need for community to be able to understand how we use github and what we do
         - utility for story-telling in branding and grant applications

## Cimply reasons

Please see Snapshot comments, if any.
