# bestape at Futurelaw and Earth Commons

## Committee decision

Comment on this response here: https://hackmd.io/TUuL1sfbRFy46g9u18ID0w

The Committee approves all three grants at $500 per grant for a total of $1500 to bestape.

## bestape reasons (Lead)

From https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants#grant-request-process , the Grant's Committee's current goals are:

* measuring and storytelling LexDAO's impact, with a flywheel included (invest in the Grants Committee)
* members hosting events or representing LexDAO at events, with a flywheel included (invest in generating the Events Committee)
* expanding our media and media distribution, with a flywheel included (invest in the Comms Committee)

That means this grant should land in one of these three `TYPE_investment` tags:

1. `report_investment` if it helps tell LexDAO's impact story
2. `event_investment` if it involves LexDAO hosting events or LexDAO members attending events
3. `promote_investment` if it helps distribute LexDAO opportunities such as our events, publications and offshoot products or services

Because this grant goes to me, I'm conflicted out. This is an `event_investment`.

### next steps

- [ ] get at least 2 new members per event or create equivalent flywheel value for the DAO, e.g. get 10 newsletter sign-ups 
- [ ] write a retrospective per event, likely on Paragraph, sharing flywheel metrics in the retrospective
- [ ] bestape shares what percent of the $500 went to expenses and if he  doesn't have the capacity then the DAO will have to recognize as income
