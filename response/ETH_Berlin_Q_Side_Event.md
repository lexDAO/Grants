## Committee decision

The Committee will use bestape's reasons.

## bestape reasons

Paolo gets a $1000 grant to represent LexDAO at ETHBerlin if he agrees to attempt these LexDAO investments:

* get new signups for lexdao.org/membership
* get new signups for lexdao.substack.com
* get new followers on x.com/lex_dao
* get new followers at warpcast.com/lexdao
* get new followers at linkedin.com/company/lexdao

And Paolo books a 30 minute recorded conversation with us at calend.ly/lexgrants for a retrospectve soon after the event completes. 

Pro-Tip: link to all the above quickly when shilling by asking people to find the links at lexdaogrant.us .  

Though Paolo only has to attempt to get new signups for membership and the newsletter, we'll ask him about his experience and look at his traction in retrospect when we make decisions in the future about these kinds of grants.

Paolo can use all or none of this $1000 grant on the Q proposal. Paolo can spend a maximum of 50% of this grant on personal expenses he'll incur by attending ETHBerlin and side events.

### next steps

Some suggestions for Paolo:

- [ ] Paolo reaches out to the Comms Committee for help promoting LexDAO at ETHBerlin & side events
- [ ] Paolo reaches out to the LexDAO community as a whole and utilizes https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/blob/main/rewards/evergreen.md to promote LexDAO at ETHBerlin & side events

What other members can do to help:

- [ ] develop merch with a call to action to sign up to our newsletter that Paolo can hand to others
