## Committee ~~decision~~ Feedback

The Committee ~~approves~~ supports the DAO Sponsorship of MCON III. Given that this is a large sponsorship representing a substantial investment of time and resources to execute, we recommend the membership evaluate the opportunity, comment, and decide on whether to allocate budget based on the merits of the proposal.
~~The $5000 sponsorship amount is high enough, and the value add of sharing with the news with the entire DAO is good enough, that we recommend this goes to a DAO-wide vote.~~

~~We recommend the entire DAO unanimously votes yes, to signal our excitement to the MCON community.~~

## bestape reasons (Lead)

From https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants#grant-request-process , the Grant's Committee's current goals are:

* measuring and storytelling LexDAO's impact, with a flywheel included (invest in the Grants Committee)
* members hosting events or representing LexDAO at events, with a flywheel included (invest in generating the Events Committee)
* expanding our media and media distribution, with a flywheel included (invest in the Comms Committee)

That means this grant should land in one of these three `TYPE_investment` tags:

1. `report_investment` if it helps tell LexDAO's impact story
2. `event_investment` if it involves LexDAO hosting events or LexDAO members attending events
3. `promote_investment` if it helps distribute LexDAO opportunities such as our events, publications and offshoot products or services

Given our extensive conversations with Yalor Moon and the rest of the MCON team, their reputation in the Web3 events space, our experience co-hosting a legal engineering side event with them at the Gitcoin House this EthDenver and our dedication to event investment, paying for sponsorship at MCON is a good fit with LexDAO.

Because MCON believes so deeply in our 'law is a public good' mission, We are getting a far better deal than the basic tier pays for:

* at least limited publicity maybe more,
* can pay in two $2500 installments,
* effectively $2500 given we still owe $2500 for the EthDenver collab,
* 10 tickets, 
* discount we can share in our newsletter,
* official side event with space to run it

I approve the grant for the basic tier sponsorship at $5000 and hope the entire DAO votes yes to fund with the general treasury pool.

## Tertius reasons

Please see Snapshot comments, if any.

## Cimply reasons
MCON is hosted by MetaCartel and EigenLayer.  Based on our most recent partnership work with MetaCartel in ETH Denver, continuing to support their in-person events is beneficial to LexDAO.  The ETH Denver partnership was a 6 part series of well constructed on-stage events that resulted in hours of well-produced online content and good exposure for what we are working on as an organization.

MCON III is a 4 day event centered primarily around Community, Governance, and Public Goods initiatives.  The community that attends is dense and builder oriented.  The sposorship is expensive which is a cause for some caution, but the outputs of prior sponsorships with MetaCartel have been successful.

As part of this sponsorship I am recommending that we create a pod to begin developing a content plan, events calendar, presence, PR, and core attendee list.  A curated group of speakers on behalf of LexDAO as well as side events should be well-structured and supported with a dedicated communications plan.  In addition, a membership initiative focused on collecting "mailing list" information for prospects with a membership packet should be created.

A full breakdown on who from the DAO is being covered for travel, room-and-board, as well as any incidental expenses.  Recommending that the max budget should not exceed $10K including the sponsorship of approximately $5K.

### next steps
- [ ] finalize budget projection for entire event
- [ ] move this to a DAO-wide vote
~~- [ ] recommend the entire DAO votes yes~~
