# Describe your project and why you classify it as a Public Good

Though LexDAO came into existence within the EVM ecosystem, our mission is to ensure 'law is a public good,' which is a public good that encompasses far more than the EVM ecosystem!

'Law is a public good' is arguably the most important public good in the EVM ecosystem, because bad law can and does destroy EVM prosperity.

Unfortunately, we are not aware of any organization other than LexDAO with a mission of ensuring 'law is a public good.' However, LexDAO is also the legal engineering guild, so we mostly focus on how to support 'law is a public good' through information technologies: 

Software might be eating the world (Andreessen), but law is the software of society (Lessig) and text is the universal interface (Unix)!

As such, LexDAO focuses on ensuring legally impactful text, whether computational or vague, is as creative commons and open source software as possible.

# Tell us more about milestones you'd like to achieve

During the bear market, we were focused on keeping the lights on. Now that we have funds again we plan to have a dedicated General Counsel who can produce public good templates for the web3 community, spin up the Journal of Legal Engineering with https://descier.science , attend and host events at multiple conferences as we did with ETHDenver 2024, turn grants-out back on including retroactive funding for groups like https://coala.global , improve our legal directory, turn weekly legal hacks back on (we already turned weekly study group back on), switch to https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz governance, complete the web3-GAAP tools proto-described at https://ape.mirror.xyz as iNFTs and legal seals and likely other initiatives by our members as we can now focus our attention on the non-essential roadmap goals.

# Why's your project important?

# How do you define impact for your project? What metrics are you tracking?

We are spending this year's funds on upgrading our metrics. Too much of our impact goes unquantified. Important metrics we are capturing include: number of active members, growth of our newsletter, attendees at our IRL vents, how many offshoots have spun out of our DAO, how many people looking for legal services awe connect with cryptolawyers.

# Share your project impact metrics and results

From epoch 3 application: we would love to work with you and other professionals to help us better capture metrics, plan a portion of our OP RetroPGF3 to create an anual impact report. We've already reached out to https://twitter.com/carl_cervone and General Magic for assistance and are in the early stages of the process. The Commons Economy Roadmap has already generated a report for us, and we're in talks with them about adding additional elements to their report. We'll likely explore hypercerts with more focus.

Update: we are now working with Clinamenic and the Commons Economy Roadmap team. https://hackmd.io/Uh7HLwKMTBiOBt27-J3X4w and https://hackmd.io/q3on-SF4SzONETb61D6kuQ
