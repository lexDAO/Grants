# Agenda for Weekly Grants Committee calls every Friday at 1500UTC
## May 31, 2024
### Key Proposals
 - [ ] [Future Law Budget Request](https://hackmd.io/KkkOHYtLS_C-7guk9MlAuw): $500 reimbursement
 
 - [ ] [Commons Economy Knowledge Element](https://hackmd.io/Uh7HLwKMTBiOBt27-J3X4w): Approved by Tertius.

  - [ ] [DC DAO Genesis](https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/blob/main/request/DC_DAO_Genesis_and_DC_Blockchain_Summit_genesis_grant.md): This appears to be a request for reimbursement of $947.72 USD.  Would support payment of this amount but in the future we should talk about events like this in advance.   

  - [ ] [ETH Berlin](https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/edit/main/request/ETH_Berlin_Q_Side_Event.md): Paolo attended and did not require any reimbursement.  He was approved for $500.

  - [ ] [Consensus Funding](https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/blob/main/request/consensus.md): Tertius is going and will require reimbursement.  Looking at an approved budget of $1500 with reimbursement for expenses.

   - [ ] [MCON III](https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/blob/main/request/MCON_III_sponsorship.md): Requesting a sponsorship of $5K, $10K, or $20K.  Mostly for branding.  No other key offerings identified.
