  - [x] Cimply to vote on the Snapshot

  - [ ] [DC DAO Genesis](https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/blob/main/request/DC_DAO_Genesis_and_DC_Blockchain_Summit_genesis_grant.md): This appears to be a request for reimbursement of $947.72 USD.

  - [ ] [ETH Berlin](https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/edit/main/request/ETH_Berlin_Q_Side_Event.md): Paolo attended and did not require any reimbursement.  He was approved for $500.

  - [ ] [Consensus Funding](https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/blob/main/request/consensus.md): Tertius is going and will require reimbursement.  Looking at an approved budget of $1500 with reimbursement for expenses.

   - [ ] [MCON III](https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/blob/main/request/MCON_III_sponsorship.md): Requesting a sponsorship of $5K, $10K, or $20K.  Mostly for branding.  No other key offerings identified.

   - [ ] [Safe Harbor](https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/blob/main/request/Safe_Harbor_Summit_sponsorship.md): Request for funds to sponsor having transcripts translated.  As a side note, Cimply has already transcribeed ETH Denver and produced one of the 6 videos.  Also posted the scripts used to do so in GitHUB.
