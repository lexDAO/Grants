Extitutional conversation here: DM https://t.me/bestape and he'll add you to the group. 

## summary facts

bestape will attend DAO DC genesis at [ethdc.xyz](ethdc.xyz) and will represent LexDAO while there. 

[DAO Coalition](https://daocoalition.org), a lexDAO offshoot, has sponsored bestape's ticket. As such, bestape is requesting $300 instead of the usual $500 to represent LexDAO at this event.

bestape will attempt to onboard new members while there. Onboarding just one new paying member will break even.

bestape will get people to follow us on Twitter , Farcaster and LinkedIn. He'll get people to sign up to our Newsletter.

Grants Committee, please respond to this request before the end of May. Thank you.
