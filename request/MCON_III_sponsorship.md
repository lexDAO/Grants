## summary facts

LexDAO Has been in conversations with the [MCON](https://mcon.fun) team about replicating our 202 registrants success at ETHDenver https://app.unlock-protocol.com/event/law-at-the-limits-denver-2024

We're speaking with the [Hats protocol](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/) team as well about including an MCON hackathon that uses Hats for legal engineering products.

As such, if we sponsor this schedule might change:

Do we pick one of these sponsorship packages or not? If not, do we suggest other kinds of collaboration for MCON?

Do we suggest a partnership to dvelop the Events Committee together?
