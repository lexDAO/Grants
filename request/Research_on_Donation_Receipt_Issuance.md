## summary

LexDAO has participated in several QF grant rounds and other open/participatory grant programs, in the spirit of promoting law as a public good. 

Some of these programs have rules (e.g. Gitcoin) about "quid pro quo" practices, prohibiting grantee projects from rewarding their donors. However, non-financial acknowledgment of donations tends to be fair game. 

Where permissible, LexDAO may wish to issue notes of acknowledgment, or donation receipts, to donors. This practice may involve certain requirements if/when LexDAO or any participating LexDAO-adjacent entity obtains tax-exempt status from the IRS.

Aside from these potential requirements, the issuance of donation receipts may prove useful in terms of accounting purposes, and in terms of building out onchain networks of trust and association. If donors were to receive non-transferable donation receipts, these receipts could serve to enrich said donors' onchain reputations within the onchain philanthropic ecosystem, and could also help LexDAO quantify and evaluate its supporter base.

LexDAO received a grant funds from the GG20 Gitcoin round that Hypercerts ran here https://gitcoindonordata.xyz/projects/lexdao/rounds/28 .

## Milestone 1: Research

This proposal suggests a modest research scope, with the goal of identifying a minimum viable practice for the issuance of onchain donation receipts. Clinamenic LLC will conduct this research, and the key deliverable will be a research report (the "report") regarding: 

1) what we would need from such a practice,
2) how well Hypercerts could meet those needs, and;
3) if alternatives like Karma HQ are a better or complementary choice. 

If Hypercerts do meet these needs, the report will include a basic implementation schema for the issuance of donation receipts using Hypercerts. 

If Hypercerts do not meet these needs, the report will suggest an alternative.

The findings from this research, if approved, will hopefully serve as a basis for an evolving set of practices and conventions around onchain philanthropic donation acknowledgment. The research itself can be published under the auspices of LexDAO, should LexDAO so choose, with Clinamenic LLC merely being credited as a contracted researcher.

Goals for LexDAO to be taken in consideration in evaluating Hypercerts:

- Ease of use for contributers and members
- Tansparency and accessibility to internal and external community
- Funnctional utility for future grant-writing
- Privacy and GDPR concerns
- Utility for invoice or recepit versus recognition of non-financial contribution

## Milestone 2: Issuance

If Hypercerts, or some suggested alternative, prove sufficient (Good Enough, Safe Enough) in meeting the identified needs, Clinamenic LLC will work with bestape to issue donation receipts to donors from GG20 and the Giveth Galactic round. 

This milestone may be considered severable and may be abandoned if, after the initial research milestone is completed, such issuance is not considered prudent by LexDAO.

## request

Milestone 1: $1000 (USDC or DAI)

Clinamenic LLC requests from the Grants Committee $1000 (USDC or DAI) for a range of 20-30 hours of work, to conduct this research, to test Hypercerts and/or comparable tools, and to produce a concise report on findings. 

The deadline for the delivery of this report will be 1 month from the approval of this proposal, but this may be extended pending approval of a deadline extension proposal, should additional needs be identified by either Clinamenic LLC or LexDAO's Grants Committee.

Upon delivery, Clinamenic LLC will issue an invoice to LexDAO, for the payment to be made onchain. 

Milestone 2: $200 (USDC or DAI)

Clinamenic LLC requests from the Grants Committee $200 (USDC or DAI) for a range of 4-6 hours of work to facilitate, with bestape, the issuance of donation receipts via Hypercerts of any other advisable alternative.

The deadline for the issuance will be two weeks after the previous milestone is completed, but this may be extended pending approval of a deadline extension proposal, should additional needs be identified by either Clinamenic LLC or LexDAO's Grants Committee.

Upon delivery, Clinamenic LLC will issue an invoice to LexDAO, for the payment to be made onchain.

The invoicing process of this engagement will, too, consitute an experiment, with the intention of refining LexDAO payroll/engagement processes.
