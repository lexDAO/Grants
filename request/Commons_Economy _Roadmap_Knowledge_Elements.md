# Commons Economy Roadmap Knowledge Elements

## summary facts

Extitutional conversation here: ________ 

CER proposal here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Lldyqq1YHwAm1RbjfW5Nv1Y-y_T7A35/view?usp=sharing

Do we give them $500 per additional knowledge element "KE" for a maximum of two elements?

We've been working with them in the extitutional conversation on the additional KEs.

The two KEs we've landed on:

"1 We think that a KE explaining in a simple way (+ from the perspective of the Commons) what's on GitHub could be very cool, and something you can always use to explain this to people that are not very technical" 

"4 We think it would be cool to write an article on the lines of “Understanding Open Legal Tech Commons”, to clarify the purpose and impact of LexDAO using language that resonates with the general public, beyond the realms of blockchain and technology specialists. (the purpose of CER)"
