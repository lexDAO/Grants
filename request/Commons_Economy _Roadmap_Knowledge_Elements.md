## summary facts

Do we give them $500 per additional KE for a maximum of two elements?

We've been working with them in the extitutional conversation on the additional KEs.

The two KEs we've landed on:

1. A KE explaining in a simple way, from the perspective of the Commons (https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Commons) what's on LexDAO’s GitHub, in the form of a blog article of 10-15 mins reading time, that you can use to explain what LexDAO is concretely building/developing to people that are not technical

2. A KE in the form of a blog article titled (preliminary, can be changed) “Understanding Open Legal Tech Commons” to clarify the purpose and impact of LexDAO, using language that resonates with the general public, beyond the realms of blockchain and technology specialists. (this is basically the purpose of the Commons Economy Roadmap!)
