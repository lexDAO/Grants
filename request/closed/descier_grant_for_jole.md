[?] Request () - **TL;DR** v2 will support multiple journals not just articles
  - Request for the development of the version 2 of a decentralized scientific journals platform in order to **fast and efficiently build the Journal of Legal Engineering-JoLE**. The platform **can also be used to build Proceedings of conferences and other journals**. The version 1 of The DeSci Journal allowed the submission of articles in a digital cooperative fashion. Version 2 will allow the submission of new journals plus the submission of articles. 
  - This initiative aims to establish a decentralized scientific journals platform, challenging the current industry with a web3 alternative operating as a digital cooperative (Figure 1). The envisioned platform empowers scientists and scholars to retain copyright, share knowledge, and benefit financially. 
- With the indispensable support of the LexDAO community, we seek to revolutionize scientific publishing, bridging technology, knowledge sharing, and financial incentives for a transformative impact.

# ProjTitle : The DeSci Journals v2

## What problems The DeSci Journals are solving?

<details><summary>web3 enabled creation without surrendering copyright</summary>
The DeSci Journals will empower collaborative creation of scientific publications, leveraging web3 principles and technologies, through their platform's digital cooperative model. These communities and their peer-reviewed publications will maintain 100% of their copyrights, share gains and monetize the work of their highly skilled content creators, such as scientists, and technical professionals. These communities and their peer-reviewed publications will maintain 100% of their copyrights, share gains and monetize the work of their highly skilled content creators, such as scientists, and technical professionals.  
</details>
    
> [!CAUTION]
> What new information will lead to suspension of project

### Argument
<details><summary>3K to betatest ¿hoping? internal revenue model better</summary>

Nowadays, Science Authors have 0%, yes zero percent, of their copyright from legacy publishing houses. Together these publishing houses generate as much revenue as the music industry, i.e., 26 bi USD/ year. We will change all this. The DeSci Journals is a starting point for Authors to be in contact with a new form of publishing and financing their scientific and technical work.
LexDAO will be able to have a share of every paper published in JOLE as percentage of authorship, a feature already included in The DeSci Journal v1 (please see attached community cash flow pie in their pitch).
How are they solving todays’ practices in the traditional scientific publications industry?
By creating an alternative to a perverse oligopolistic scientific publication industry which generates 26Bi USD/ year. In this industry, authors (scientists, professionals and, scholars), reviewers and most editors (also scientists) do not get paid for working in the peer-reviewing process of papers for science journals. Authors: 1) pay for publishing, 2) pay for open access and moreover, 3) have copyright expropriated. Universities and Research Institutions pay shockingly high annual subscription fees so that alumni and staff have access to journals.
Scientific publishing houses and science journals have outrageously high publication fees. These fees range from 2 to 6k USD for 1 paper, some charge 10k-15 USD/ paper. Open access is another 2-4k USD. Currently, it is right to say that the scientific publication industry hinders the advance of human knowledge. 
Paying attention only to their profits, legacy scientific journals: 
•	act as filters to what they believe is high quality research worth publishing, 
•	use high rejection rates which are uncoupled from merit, significance, and quality, 
•	take a long time from submission to publishing, 
•	undermine the expectations of the scientific community and the development of the human society. 
## How will this benefit the LexDAO ecosystem?
The DeSci Journals stand as a groundbreaking paradigm in the realm of real-world applications, ingeniously crafted to decentralize and elevate technical and scientific publications through innovative business models. 
Harnessing the power of decentralized solutions, underpinned by the web3 community ethos, it not only facilitates the seamless scaling of web3 primitives originating in blockchain technologies but also pioneers inventive alternatives for the broader public, utilizing decentralized communities as the primary gateway to web3 for tokens, NFTs, and related technologies.
Our selection of The DeSci Journals is grounded in its advanced development stage, goals alignment, and the advantage of knowing their founders. This choice will position LexDAO at the intersection of cutting-edge features (e.g. % of authorship for the DAO, 100% maintenance of author’s copyright, papers as NFTs, secondary market formation) and scientific discourse. By collaborating with The DeSci Journals, we not only capitalize on its technical merits but also tap into a flourishing ecosystem that aligns with our vision for the future of scientific communication.
The adoption of The DeSci Journals by the scientific community is poised to generate tangible, real-world use cases, amplifying its utilization and impact. This transformative approach to publishing technical and scientific content aspires to reshape societal perspectives, interactions, applications, and investments in science. The DeSci Journals envisions ushering in a new era of decentralized excellence, with LexDAO as its traction community, thereby revolutionizing the landscape of scholarly communication and catalyzing a substantial shift in the dissemination of knowledge.

## How receiving the grant would help The DeSci Journal’s team with the development of the version 2 of the project?
Utilizing the grant funds, they will strategically allocate resources to achieve the following objectives:
Test v2 and Engage Potential Communities: 
•	Initiate discussions with potential communities to explain the details of our technical and scientific paper publishing solution using percentage of authorship, open and closed access and, NFTs.
•	Understand the specific needs and features required, paving the way for targeted Alpha tests within science and technical niches.
Peer-Review and Editorial Payment Validation (v2):
Validate the peer-review payment process, integrating digital currencies payments, $desci tokens, and a percentage-based royalties’ model. In fact, on October 7th 2022, they created a pre-token on the Polygon network which they have been using in their @deScier Discord community for rewards and incentives https://polygonscan.com/token/0xB83ac7456Bb239658502e31a351b10054455dc5a

<details>
<summary>$3K + 0.2 FTE x 36k(@bestape) = 6.6k </summary>
This is a project which will grant $3k to the deScier project team to create JoLE by collaborating with them in the construction of version 2 of The DeSci Journal. 
Version 2 will make possible for us to build the Journal of Legal Engineering-JoLE on top of their existing platform. To build based on The DeSci Journal framework will allow us a faster development and readiness to accept and publish legal engineering abstracts and papers. This development which allowed to have our own journal up and running has started around 4 weeks ago and is currently deployed online.

## Proposal

### Task Breakdown
<!-- Graphic form is easier to grok, details in github project-->
[Example](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams)

Goals:

1.	Create JoLE
2.  Make The DeSci Journal a platform for Scientific Journals to be built from Communities, Colleges, Universities, Movements, Conferences, for example.
3.	Allow users to have their own Journals, by Admin decision. Need login.
4.	Allow Authors to choose which Journal they will publish. Need login.
5.	Allow Papers published in a specific Journal to be displayed as belonging to that Journal, in addition to the pool of all open access papers on the platform. No login required.

## This is not a project but a repeat of their proposal - what is `Specific Measureable Achievable Realistic Timeframe` ?!?
<!-- eg @bestape to get one amucus curia into platform and show LexDAO -->
1. ==one== amicus curia analysis in journal article format
2. @bestape estimates ???/tba\ 0.2FTE ~2 months to do ?
3. by 4Q2024 (generous time in case busy) otherwise abandoned
4. are there the necessary staff to get the QC  eg editorial board needed
5. ==3Q2024 otherwise paused== to get project roughly detailed, 4Q for ɑ-test 
    
### Assumptions
1. [Design assets](https://github.com/lexDAO/LexDAO-Design-Assets/tree/master) may need to be expanded, OK for electronic but may prove insufficient for print

> [!WARNING]
> Will have sufficient editorial quality control, pipeline of articles, and revenue model (eg corporate sponsorship)
> What assumptions if proven wrong will lead to abandonment

### Deliverables and Timeline

### Tasks for Making The DeSci Journal a platform for Scientific Journals. Timeline: Started: 16th February, 2024. Delivery: 13th April, 2024.
1. Add an 's' in Journal on the homepage (to make “ Journals ” plural).
1.    Add a search for a specific magazine in Search on the homepage > “ Journal ”.
1. Edit the texts in the homepage Search bar to: “ Find paper ”, “ Author ”, “ Journal ”.
1. 	Add the covers of Journals approved by the Admin to the homepage.
1. To edit text “ Want to publish a paper?” to “Want to publish a paper? Want to create a Journal? almost at the footer.
1. On the same button instead of “ Start Publishing now !” change to “ Publish a paper or Create a Journal ”. This button has a link to the submission form.
1. 	Edit the left panel button (when logged in) from “ Submit new article ” to just “ Submit ”. 
1. 	Modify the article/ paper submission form to allow submission responses from New Journals.
1. Create a drop in the same existing paper submission form down menu: a) Submit a paper, b) Create a new Journal.
1. This drop down menu makes some items or some sections appear or disappear, depending on the choice. If the chosen option is “ Submit a paper ”, everything remains the same, except for the addition of a drop down menu with the name of the Journal to which this paper will be submitted. Important. There are already 6 Journals that we can add to this drop down menu. Each one follows the paper publication flow: a)The DeSci Journal, b)Journal of Legal Engineering | JOLE, c) Biohackers Protocols by Augmented Limitless (or other name), d) Proceedings of LongBio I | Vitalia 2024 ( LongBio I-Roman numeral, will have LongBio II), e)Mushroom Protocols (or other name), d) TCC Journal | The Capstone Collection Journal
1. 	If the chosen option is Create a new Journal :
1. The drop down menu of “ Article Type ” becomes a drop down menu of the Origin of the Magazine “The Journal originates from”: a)New area of knowledge, b) Community, c) University, d) Faculty, e) Conference, f) Event, g) Association, h) Other
1.	Add a tag with the name of the Journal to this paper to allow filtering and searches.
1. Delete the “ Drop ” section your file here ” if “New Journal ” is chosen in the drop down menu from section 1.10.
1. 	Edit the “Abstract” section to “ Rationale ”, if “New Journal ” is chosen in the drop down menu from section 1.10. “Type your abstract” for “Type your reasons”. At the "?" edit “Abstract might change after revision…” to “Give reasons for creating a new Journal”.
1. The “Cover” section remains as it is for both cases/forms.
1. Authorship ” section becomes “Editor-in- Chief ”, if “New Journal ” is chosen in the drop down menu from section 1.10. If it doesn't work, we'll add text explaining “ Authorship or Editor-in- Chief ”.
1. 	The text “Add authors for this paper” becomes “ Add Editorial Board Members, if already available”, if “ New Journal” is chosen in the drop down menu in section 1.10. This section must be editable later (to add Board Members , even via the Admin panel).
1. 	The text “Drag the authors to reorder the list ” becomes “Drag to reorder”.
1. 	The “ Editors / Reviewers ” section becomes “ Reviewers ”, if “New Journal ” is chosen in the drop down menu from section 1.10. If it doesn't work, we leave the text “ Editors / Reviewers ”.
1. 	Delete text “At least 1 editor and 1 reviewer approval are required to publish the paper. Editors and Reviewers cannot be authors in the paper”.
1. 	In the paper submission form , in the “Access Type” section , please edit “Decide if the Project is Open Access or Paid Access” to “Decide if Open Access or Paid Access”.
1. 	The "Access Type " section can be deleted if "New Journal " is chosen in the dropdown down menu from section 1.10, if possible.
1. 	The “Submit article for review” button becomes “Submit for review”.
1. 	Edit the “ Support ” text to “ Instructions ” listed under “Links” in the footer and edit the link to https://descier-1.gitbook.io/the-desci-journal-handbook/ and not the WhatsApp number 
1. 	Add 2 columns to the database for each submission , 1 column for the NFT link/ hash that will be generated manually after publication, 1 column for the NFT URL. As long as the hash and URL are not generated, the online publication and the pdf of the publication will contain “in progress ” for these 2 pieces of information. “NFT hash ” and “NFT URL”. And place to edit, when the information is available.
1. 	When the Admin approves the submission, the Magazine cover goes to the homepage.
1. 	When the Admin approves the submission, the name of the Journal goes to the drop down menu on the paper submission form.
1. 	When the Admin approves the submission, the Journal name goes to the Journals list in the Search bar on the homepage.
1. 	When the Admin approves the submission, create an email flow that is sent to leader@descier.science for the Admin to provide the mint hash and url.
1. 	Add a link to the magazine cover on the homepage that leads to the papers published under that magazine. If there are no papers yet , the link takes you to Latest Papers (on the homepage). 
1. 	When there is a submission to a specific Journal, the paper continues with the current flow, where an email arrives to the Admin who manually forwards an email to the Editor-in-Chief of the journal communicating the submission and the next steps to be adopted.
1. 	The Admin continues to monitor the review by the Magazine's Editor and Reviewers on the Admin Dashboard.
1. 	The Admin must be able to add a new version of the submission (currently only the Author can). This will be a version formatted by the Admin himself and already prepared for final publication ( LaTeX via overleaf , manually).
1. 	The approved paper goes to the homepage in the list of published papers as today.
1. 	The approved paper will also go to the list of papers of the specific Journal chosen by the Author.
1. 	In “Top papers of the Week”, in addition to the “type of paper ” in the tag , if possible add a tag with the “name of the Journal” to which the paper belongs as well.
1. 	Allow Papers published in a specific Journal to be displayed as belonging to that Journal.
1. 	Leave all papers on the homepage in the “all papers ” pool on the platform.
1. 	Submission to a new Journal goes to the Admin Dashboard, separate from paper submission . Add “ Journals for Approval ” in the Admin panel, separate from “ Articles for Approval ”.
