## summary facts

LexDAO cohosted the [https://lu.ma/safe_harbor](https://lu.ma/safe_harbor) Summit. It was a great success!

Some impact from the Summit:

* over 40 attendees 
* around 100 people connected online
* videos of the participations Will be uploaded to the vitalia YouTube
* some attendees now planning the DUNA day and MCON III events
* will soon produce AI tree sensemaking artifacts from the conference's panels

We informally discussed paying for sponsorship at the Summit. [Vitalia](https://vitalia.city) covered over $5000 in costs and [Ixian](https://Ixian.tech) paid the rest, roughly $2000.

Can LexDAO pay $1000 in sponsorship? This will also include translating the Summit's transcripts into easily digestible knowledge trees, assuming our conversations with the provider continue to develop. We also plan to translate the ETHDenver event's transcript into a knowledge tree, likely starting with. ETHDenver since the transcript is already available.
