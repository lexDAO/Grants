# Status Notes

## Grant Budget
Discussion on what the team budget is on what to manage needs to be addressed

### Payments

## Policy and Posture
### Definitions
Policy: are anything that are high level initiatives that conform to the constitution and the general objectives of the organization.

Posture: tactical short term goals that we want to adopt in achieving to align with policy

### Grant Posture Status
#### External Funding
At this time, LexDAO is not funding external projects
* Reasoning:
  - Because we currently have concerns on our ability to fund our own operations before we begin funding additional projects

#### Events Funding
People coming to represent LexDAO is a good thing
 - We want to see applications and proposals to justify the work they will do in 

##### Events Committee
 We want to push this to an OC conversation agenda item for discussion
