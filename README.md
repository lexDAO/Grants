# grant request process

Please reach out to grants.lead@lexdao.org if you would like to request a grant. 

Currently, we are only approving grants requested by [LexDAO members](https://lexdao.org/membership) or nonprofit business-to-business. Our priority are grants for: 

* measuring and storytelling LexDAO's impact (invest in the Grants Committee)
* members hosting events or representing LexDAO at events (invest in generating the Events Committee)
* expanding our media and media distribution (invest in the Comms Committee)

If your grant is approved, it'll go through this process:

* after working with you on it, your request will be published by us at https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/tree/main/request
* our response will be published at https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/tree/main/response
* the outcome will be published at https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/tree/main/outcome

Most grants that get to the published Github request stage are approved, but not all. The ones that aren't approved still receive reasons about why we made the decision.

# get $LxGrntCrd!

Why? Be part of a fun institutional DAO localism experiment, gain credibility when you make grant requests and with the DAO in general, maybe get some work for membership hours knocked off.  

Active rewards are listed at https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/tree/main/rewards .

You do not need to be a [LexDAO member](https://lexdao.org/membership) to qualify.

This Document example is for the evergreen reward https://hackmd.io/Es5rhJuAR7-ZriTRAU1FIQ#share-an-idea-for-a-LxGrntCrd-reward-that-we-decide-to-include-as-a-reward .

Once done, email the URL link to the proposal to grants.lead@lexdao.org. We'll respond to you via your email.

If you have questions, email grants.lead@lexdao.org .

## what

Inspired by https://thankarb.com/seasons/49?utm_campaign=GG20 , LexDAO Grants Committee is offering '$LxGrntCrd' reward points for contributions to LexGrants!

Please send your $LxGrntCrd reward request to our credKali at https://app.kali.gg/daos/42161/0x03d5222ef39dfeefd68e0a1bc22811cee618db7c/propose and notify grants.lead@lexdao.org that you've done it.

We'll decide later how $LxGrntCrd will be honored or how it'll be redeemed, but $LxGrntCrd will likely include redemption for a max percentage of total hours contributed to work for membership. Please note that if you do not honor this attestation, we migth have to shut down the experiment via our at least 52% at all times majority:

* "I promise not to trade $LxGrntCrd with another person unless a proposal passes in this credKali that allows me to do so; I acknowledge that lexgrants.eth might toggle $LxGrntCrd back to non-transferable if I break my promise not to trade $LxGrntCrd."

You do not need to be a [LexDAO member](https://lexdao.org/membership) to qualify.

This is an ETH localism fast-turnaround experiment (constitutional). It's specifically about localism in DAOs (instutional), though ETH localism in general is also about local DAOs (extitutional). The vanishing point set is `constitute( institute( constitute( ... ) ) , extitute( constitute( ... ) ) )` .

### decipher tip

We can extract the attestation with an LLM such as https://magictool.ai/tool/hex-to-text-converter/.

## token supply control system

LexDAO Grants will always retain at least 52% of the supply at all times. 

In other words, only 48% of supply can be in circulation. 

So, with our current fixed supply of 1,000,000 tokens, **a maximum of less than 520,000 tokens can enter circulation**.

Our requirement is over 50%, but Kali defaults to at least 52%.

We put 0.1 ETH in the $LxGrntCrd treasury to show how the Redemption mechanism could be used in the future, but the choice to allow that will be in LexDAO's sole discretion because, in part, we will always retain at least 52% of the supply.
