# introducing $LxGrntCrd

Active rewards are listed at https://github.com/lexDAO/Grants/tree/main/rewards .

## what

Inspired by https://thankarb.com/seasons/49?utm_campaign=GG20 , LexDAO Grants Committee is offering '$LxGrntCrd' reward points for contributions to LexGrants!

Please send your $LxGrntCrd reward request to our credKali at https://app.kali.gg/daos/42161/0x03d5222ef39dfeefd68e0a1bc22811cee618db7c/propose .

We're still working on enumerated rewards at https://hackmd.io/VsaHxtmITRiiocz2ybRXlw#eligible-activities-for-rewards but feel free to email grants.lead@lexdao.org if you did or plan to do something that you think deserves an award. Please note that, so far, we're only contemplating activities that promote our projects on QF matching rounds.

We'll decide later how $LxGrntCrd will be honored or redeemed for, but it'll likely include redemption for a max amount of hours contributed to work for membership.

You do not need to be a [LexDAO member](https://lexdao.org/membership) to qualify.

This is an ETH localism experiment. It's specifically about localism in DAOs, though ETH localism in general is also about local DAOs.

## token supply control system

LexDAO Grants will always retain at least 52% of the supply at all times. 

In other words, only 48% of supply can be in circulation.

Our requirement is over 50%, but Kali defaults to at least 52%.

We put 0.1 ETH in the $LxGrntCrd treasury to show how the Redemption mechanism could be used in the future, but the choice to allow that will be in LexDAO's sole discretion because, in part, we will always retain at least 52% of the supply.
