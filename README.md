## what

Inspired by https://thankarb.com/seasons/49?utm_campaign=GG20 , LexDAO Grants Committee is offering '$LxGrntCrd' reward points for contributions to LexGrants!

Please send your $LxGrntCrd reward request to our credKali at https://app.kali.gg/daos/42161/0x03d5222ef39dfeefd68e0a1bc22811cee618db7c/propose and notify grants.lead@lexdao.org that you've done it.

We'll decide later how $LxGrntCrd will be honored or redeemed for, but it'll likely include redemption for a max amount of hours contributed to work for membership.

You do not need to be a [LexDAO member](https://lexdao.org/membership) to qualify.

This is an ETH localism fast-turnaround experiment. It's specifically about localism in DAOs, though ETH localism in general is also about local DAOs.

### decipher tip

We can extract the attestation with an LLM such as https://magictool.ai/tool/hex-to-text-converter/.

## token supply control system

LexDAO Grants will always retain at least 52% of the supply at all times. 

In other words, only 48% of supply can be in circulation.

Our requirement is over 50%, but Kali defaults to at least 52%.

We put 0.1 ETH in the $LxGrntCrd treasury to show how the Redemption mechanism could be used in the future, but the choice to allow that will be in LexDAO's sole discretion because, in part, we will always retain at least 52% of the supply.
